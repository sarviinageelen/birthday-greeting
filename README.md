# Single HTML Birthday Greeting 🎉

This repository hosts a simple static site used to display an interactive birthday greeting.  
It is designed as a single-page web app using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Animated gradient background with a high-end feel
- Rotating set of “nickname” greetings (see the `config.names` array in `index.html`)
- Navigation buttons to switch between names, with auto‑rotate functionality
- Responsive design and accessible markup (ARIA attributes and focus styles)
- Ready for GitHub Pages deployment (see the `CNAME` file for the custom domain)

## Files
- `index.html` – The page markup, styling, and client-side script.
- `CNAME` – Domain configuration for GitHub Pages.
  
Feel free to modify `index.html` to change the names or adjust the animation settings.  
Host the contents on any static web server or GitHub Pages to share your custom greeting!
